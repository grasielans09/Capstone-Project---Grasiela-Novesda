Bangkok Airbnb Listing Analysis
This repository contains my final capstone project analyzing Airbnb listings in Bangkok, Thailand. The analysis aims to provide insights into the distribution, market potential, popular room types, pricing strategies, and occupancy rates to inform decision-making for Airbnb hosts or real estate investors.

The project examines Airbnb data for Bangkok, focusing on the following key research questions:

How are Airbnb listings distributed across Bangkok?
Which neighborhoods offer high market potential with low competition?
What types of rooms are most popular in each area?

How do public infrastructure and amenities influence Airbnb listings in specific areas?
